newsable is a news reading website made using react. It uses 'newsapi' to retrieve latest news.




## Demo

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zakm7/newsable-react.git
  cd newsable-react
  npm start
```

Please Read⚠️:
- 'newspi' does only provide api endpoints to developers who have purchased their 'production' plan for $449. Thereby we have restricted our website to run only on localhosts. Thank You!
